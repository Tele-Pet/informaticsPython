# Exercise 6.5  Take the following Python code that stores a string:â€˜ str = 'X
# -DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475' Use find and string slicing to extract the portion
# of the string after the colon character and then use the float function to
# convert the extracted string into a floating point number.


str = 'X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475'

colonPos = str.find(':')
data = str[colonPos + 1:]
print float(data)
# print type(float(data)) # Uncomment this to confirm type
