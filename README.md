What are some common mistakes when using git?

* 1. Tracking reproducible non-text files.
* 2. Committing to wrong branch.
* 3. Leaving useless, and incomprehensible commit messages.
4. Working on shared (development, master, etc) branches.
5. Not rebasing your feature branches to development branch.
6. Poorly handling conflicts.
7. Tracking environment dependent files (Eg. conf.php).
8. Not tracking" templates" of environment dependent files (Eg. conf.php.tmp).
9. Tracking end-user-manipulated files and directories (Eg. "uploads" folder).
10. Tracking "crap files" (Eg. "error.log", "thumbs.db").
11. Forgetting to track needed but currently empty directories.
